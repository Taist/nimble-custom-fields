Addon adds custom field "Industry" to Deals. It is displayed in the deals list, and you can group deals by it.
Industries list is set in "Settings -> Deals".

We plan to extend the addon to allow creation of any custom fields to any entities like Deals, Contacts, Companies and Activities with custom behaviour.

So if you need any specific custom deals, please write in the comments below what exactly you need, and we will offer you a solution.
