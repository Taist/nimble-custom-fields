Addon enables to add multiple custom fields to deals. 

You can view them on the deal pages and in the deals list. The deals list can also be grouped by them.

Every field now is of "single choice" type - allows to select a single value from a list of values. 

Examples of fields:
===================
* Industry (Healthcare, IT, Transportation, ...)
* Lead source (Events, Online ads, Recommendations,...)
  
How to use:
-----------
0. **Enable addon** :)
1. **Adding new custom field**: 
  * go to "Settings -> Deals", scroll down to new section "Custom fields"
  * press "Add new custom field", input field name, for example, `Industry`, and press `Save`.  A row with your field name will appear.
  * a new link with your field name appears below - in our example it will be `Add Industry` - use it to add a new value to the list.
2. Set field values while creating or editing any deal.
3. Fields will be displayed on deal pages and in the deals list.
