Addon allows you to add multiple custom fields to deals. 

You can view them in deal pages and in the deals list. The deals list can also be grouped by them.

Supported field types:

* **list** to choose one value from the pre-defined list
* **text** to input any text

## Examples of fields:

* Industry (Healthcare, IT, Transportation, ...)
* Lead source (Events, Online ads, Recommendations,...)
  
## How to use:

1. Adding new custom field: 
  * go to "Settings -> Deals", scroll down to new section "Custom fields"
  * press "Add new custom field", choose field type and name.  A row with your field name will appear.
  * if you are creating a **list** field, a new link with your field name appears below - in our example it will be `Add Industry` - use it to add values to the list.
2. Set field values while creating or editing any deal.
3. Viewing fields in the deals list: a link "Displayed custom fields" appears above the deals table - use it to choose what fields to display
